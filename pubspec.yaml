# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none'

# [Corrected/Modernized Versions]
version: 1.0.0+1

environment:
  # FIX: Dart SDK version updated to a stable range compatible with the latest package versions.
  # Use a stable range like 3.4.0, or use a current version like 3.5.0, 3.6.0, etc.
  # If you must use 3.8.1, ensure it's correct for your local setup, 
  # but using a range is safer for development.
  sdk: '>=3.4.0 <4.0.0'

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  
  # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8
  url_launcher: ^6.3.0
  google_fonts: ^6.3.2
  provider: ^6.1.1
  flutter_dotenv: ^6.0.0

  # FIX: Updated Firebase and related package versions to modern stable releases (as of 2024).
  # The versions provided were likely old and incompatible with the Dart SDK.
  firebase_core: ^3.1.0 
  firebase_auth: ^5.1.0 
  cloud_firestore: ^5.0.1 
  google_sign_in: ^6.2.1

  # FIX: 'google_sign_in_web' is NOT needed when 'google_sign_in' is present.
  # The core 'google_sign_in' package automatically includes the web implementation.
  # If you are using custom web interop code, you still need the 'web' and 'js' packages.
  web: ^0.5.1
  js: ^0.7.1 # Correctly placed in dependencies if used in the main app logic (like your web interop file).
  intl: ^0.20.2
  image_picker: ^1.2.1
  firebase_storage: ^12.2.0
  flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.14.4

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

  # FIX: Updated flutter_lints to a compatible version range for modern Flutter
  flutter_lints: ^4.0.0 
  # FIX: The 'js' package was moved to dependencies, as it's used in your main app logic (web_google_sign_in.dart).
  # If you ONLY used 'js' for testing, you could leave it here, but typically it's a dependency.
  # js: ^0.7.0 # REMOVED from dev_dependencies
